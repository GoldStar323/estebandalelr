# VSCode Tips, Tricks and Clicks
## Inverted sidebar
You might have read about this one somewhere else but it's the first thing I do whenever I get into VSCode.
Moving the sidebar to the right side helps you open and close it at will without moving your main editor.

Check out how awful the default experience is:

And check how great it is after the change:
<Bleed>![Sidebar-right](/sidebar-right.gif)</Bleed>

Other benefits include that your unused space gets used and you may cover the side without ruining your experience

This is very easy to set up, just right-click on the sidebar and select `Move Primary Side Bar Right` or go to settings and search for sidebar.
