# The cool git: Git switch

**TL;DR:** Changes branches.

**For humans:** Stop using the overloaded ```checkout``` and use the safe ```switch```.

Switching branches is probably one of the first things you learn when you start using git. With the ```checkout``` command handy, you go from your ```bugfix``` branch to the ```main``` to fetch, merge and push and finish that pesky task, and then you start learning all what ```git checkout``` is capable of.

You panic knowing that an innocent branch autocomplete can also delete all your changes.

This was the thought process of the Git team and they decided to fix in a retro compatible way.

** Introducing: ```git switch``` **

This command, much smaller in surface does only _one_ thing: switching branches. It also has very few options, but let's see it with an example.

Let's say your repo has these branches:

```shell 
> git branch
* feature
  master
  dev
```

You want to jump to another branch? Use ```switch```

```shell 
> git switch dev
Switched to branch 'dev'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/dev'.
```

> Look at that, it checks if we are up to date, but what happens if we aren't?

You want to jump to the _main_ branch? Use ```switch```

```shell 
> git switch main
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 6 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
```

You want to create another branch? Use ```switch```

```shell 
> git switch -c bugfix
Switched to a new branch 'bugfix'
> git branch
* bugfix
  dev
  master
  feature
```

But the aha! moment comes when you ```switch``` to a remote branch

```shell 
git switch feature/other-remote-branch
Switched to a new branch 'feature/other-remote-branch'
branch 'feature/other-remote-branch' set up to track 'origin/feature/other-remote-branch'.
```

And what happens when you try a file with ```switch```? Nothing! 

```shell 
git switch package.json
fatal: invalid reference: package.json
```

And this _is a feature_. No more losing your files for autocompleting as with ```checkout```
