# The cool git: 2. Git switch

**TL;DR:** Changes branches.

**For humans:** Stop using the overloaded ```checkout``` and use the safe ```switch```.

Switching branches is probably one of the first things you learn when you start using git. With the ```checkout``` command handy, you go from your ```bugfix``` branch to the ```main``` to fetch, merge and push and finish that pesky task, and then you start learning all what ```git checkout``` is capable of.

You panic knowing that an innocent branch autocomplete can also delete all your changes.

This was the thought process of the Git team and they decided to fix in a retro compatible way.

** Introducing: ```git switch``` **

This command, much smaller in surface does only _one_ thing: switching branches. It also has very few options, but let's see it with an example.

Let's say your repo has these branches:
```shell 
> git branch
* feature
  master
  dev
```
