# Memes
The word rhymes with *dream*, or that's how I pronounce it.

They've been comics, ragecomics, meta colorful weird stuff, animals, text only... I wouldn't know how to properly describe them but I know their impact.

They've come from being a niche in the dark corners of the internet to being shared by my grandparents.

Memes convey ideas, most time mocking, but ideas anyways.

Will their power be exploited? Yes. Just look for political memes, we've all laughed at politicians...

What are they?
